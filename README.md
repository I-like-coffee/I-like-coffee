- **Challenges Faced**
  <details><summary>Challenge 1:</summary>
  <p>
    Challenge: Reducing client latency (PING)<br>Solution: Use of low intensity loops for UI elements (background clouds etc.). Switching to a "Tween and redo" method        rather than a "Create and destroy" method as it severely impacts client response times.
  </p>
  </details>
  <details><summary>Challenge 2:</summary>
  <p>
    Challenge: Eliminating use of exploits to mimic high score<br>Solution: Switched to a server-orientated input detection method rather than the noticeably                  untrustworthy client-sided detection.
